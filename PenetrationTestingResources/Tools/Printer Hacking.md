### [PRET - Printer Exploitation Toolkit](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET)

PRET is a new tool for printer security testing developed in the scope of a Master's Thesis at Ruhr University Bochum. It connects to a device via network or USB and exploits the features of a given printer language. Currently PostScript, PJL and PCL are supported which are spoken by most laser printers. This allows cool stuff like capturing or manipulating print jobs, accessing the printer's file system and memory or even causing physical damage to the device. All attacks are documented in detail in the Hacking Printers Wiki.
