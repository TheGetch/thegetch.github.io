### [SGN](https://github.com/EgeBalci/sgn)

SGN is a polymorphic binary encoder for offensive security purposes such as generating statically undetectable binary payloads. It uses an additive feedback loop to encode given binary instructions similar to LSFR. This project is the reimplementation of the original Shikata ga nai in golang with many improvements.
