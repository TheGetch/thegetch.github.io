### [JWT Attack Walk-Through](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2019/january/jwt-attack-walk-through/)

There’s a well-known defect with older versions of certain libraries where you can trick a JSON Web Token (JWT) consumer that expects tokens signed using asymmetric cryptography into accepting a symmetrically signed token.

### [Attacking JWT authentication](https://www.sjoerdlangkemper.nl/2016/09/28/attacking-jwt-authentication/)

JSON Web Tokens or JWTs are used by some web applications instead of traditional session cookies. Because of their statelessness and the signature implementation there are some security issues that are specific to JWTs. This post describes some ways you can verify that a JWT implementation is secure.

### [JWT Hacking 101](https://trustfoundry.net/jwt-hacking-101/)

As JavaScript continues its quest for world domination, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are becoming more and more prevalent in application security.  Many applications use them, so it has become very important for me to know as much as I can and I want to share what I’ve learned. In this blog post I will discuss what JWTs are and common vulnerabilities that come along with them.

Basic JWT attacks.

### [Practical Approaches for Testing and Breaking JWT Authentication](https://mazinahmed.net/blog/breaking-jwt/)

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a popular authentication/authorization protocol. It integrates cryptographic signatures into JSON objects to verify the integrity of the object.

This article will cover the background of JWT, wrong implementations, and practical approaches to test and break JWT. It will also cover a section of constructive criticism, where I will be discussing each known public tool for testing JWT, and the issues I faced with it where I had come to the idea of developing jwt-pwn.

### [JWT (JSON Web Token) (in)security](https://research.securitum.com/jwt-json-web-token-security/)

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a mechanism that is often used in REST APIs it can be found in popular standards, such as OpenID Connect, but we will also encounter it sometimes using OAuth2. It is used both in large companies and smaller organisations. There are many libraries available that support JWT, and the standard itself has “rich support for cryptographic mechanisms”. Does all this mean JWT is inherently safe? Let’s see.

### [{JWT}.{Attack}.Playbook](https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool/wiki)

This wiki is a project to document the known attacks and potential security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations you may come across when testing JSON Web Tokens, and to provide a repeatable methodology for attacking them.
