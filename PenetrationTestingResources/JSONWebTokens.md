### [Attacking JWT authentication](https://www.sjoerdlangkemper.nl/2016/09/28/attacking-jwt-authentication/)

JSON Web Tokens or JWTs are used by some web applications instead of traditional session cookies. Because of their statelessness and the signature implementation there are some security issues that are specific to JWTs. This post describes some ways you can verify that a JWT implementation is secure.

### [JWT Hacking 101](https://trustfoundry.net/jwt-hacking-101/)
