### Attacking JWT authentication

JSON Web Tokens or JWTs are used by some web applications instead of traditional session cookies. Because of their statelessness and the signature implementation there are some security issues that are specific to JWTs. This post describes some ways you can verify that a JWT implementation is secure.

### JWT Hacking 101

As JavaScript continues its quest for world domination, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are becoming more and more prevalent in application security.  Many applications use them, so it has become very important for me to know as much as I can and I want to share what I’ve learned. In this blog post I will discuss what JWTs are and common vulnerabilities that come along with them.
