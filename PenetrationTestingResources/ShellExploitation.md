### [7 Linux Shells Using Built-in Tools](https://www.lanmaster53.com/2011/05/7-linux-shells-using-built-in-tools/)

There are many distributions of Linux, and they all do things a little different regarding default security and built-in tool sets. Which means when engaging these different flavors during a pentest, what works against one Linux target to get an interactive shell, may not work against another. Well, not to worry my friends, there are many techniques for spawning shells, specifically reverse shells, from Linux, and one or more of these techniques is bound to be available no matter which distro you're looking at.

### [Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md)

If you’re lucky enough to find a command execution vulnerability during a penetration test, pretty soon afterwards you’ll probably want an interactive shell.
If it’s not possible to add a new account / SSH key / .rhosts file and just log in, your next step is likely to be either throwing back a reverse shell or binding a shell to a TCP port.  This page deals with the former.

### [Creating Metasploit Payloads](https://netsec.ws/?p=331)

Often one of the most useful (and to the beginner underrated) abilities of Metasploit is the msfpayload module. Multiple payloads can be created with this module and it helps something that can give you a shell in almost any situation. For each of these payloads you can go into msfconsole and select exploit/multi/handler. Run ‘set payload’ for the relevant payload used and configure all necessary options (LHOST, LPORT, etc). Execute and wait for the payload to be run.
