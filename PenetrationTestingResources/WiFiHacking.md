### [How to Hack WiFi Password Easily Using New Attack On WPA/WPA2](https://thehackernews.com/2018/08/how-to-hack-wifi-password.html)

Discovered by the lead developer of the popular password-cracking tool Hashcat, Jens 'Atom' Steube, the new WiFi hack works explicitly against WPA/WPA2 wireless network protocols with Pairwise Master Key Identifier (PMKID)-based roaming features enabled.

### [Cracking WPA2 Passwords Using the New PMKID Hashcat Attack](<https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-wi-fi-cracking-wpa2-passwords-using-new-pmkid-hashcat-attack-0189379/>)

Cracking the password for WPA2 networks has been roughly the same for many years, but a new attack requires less interaction and information than previous techniques and has the added advantage of being able to target access points with no one connected. This new attack against the PMKID uses Hashcat to crack WPA passwords and allows hackers to find networks with weak passwords more easily.

### [Pwning WPA/WPA2 Networks With Bettercap and the PMKID Client-Less Attack](https://www.evilsocket.net/2019/02/13/Pwning-WiFi-networks-with-bettercap-and-the-PMKID-client-less-attack/#.XGUsG5SMxYE.reddit)

In this post, Iâ€™ll talk about the new WiFi related features that have been recently implemented into bettercap, starting from how the EAPOL 4-way handshake capturing has been automated, to a whole new type of attack that will allow us to recover WPA PSK passwords of an AP without clients.
