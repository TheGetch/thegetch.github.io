### [Linux Hacking Case Studies Part 2: NFS](https://blog.netspi.com/linux-hacking-case-studies-part-2-nfs/)

This blog will walk through how to attack insecure NFS exports and setuid configurations in order to gain a root shell on a Linux system. This should be a fun overview for people new to penetration testing, or those looking for a NFS refresher. This is the second of a five part blog series highlighting entry points and local privilege escalation paths commonly found on Linux systems during real network penetration tests.Â  The first blog focused on attacking Rsync and can be found [here](https://blog.netspi.com/linux-hacking-case-studies-part-1-rsync/).
