### [CTF Time](https://ctftime.org/)
 
There are a lot of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions in our days, some of them have excellent tasks, but in most cases they're forgotten just after the CTF finished. We decided to make some kind of CTF archive and of course, it'll be too boring to have just an archive, so we made a place, where you can get some another CTF-related info - current overall Capture The Flag team rating, per-team statistics etc.

### [SANS Holiday hack Challenges](https://holidayhackchallenge.com/past-challenges/)

Annual hacking challenge from SANS.


### [flAWS](http://flaws.cloud/)

Through a series of levels you'll learn about common mistakes and gotchas when using Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are no SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows, or many of the other vulnerabilities you might have seen before. As much as possible, these are AWS specific issues. 



### [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/)

Hack The Box is an online platform allowing you to test your penetration testing skills and exchange ideas and methodologies with other members of similar interests. It contains several challenges that are constantly updated. Some of them simulating real world scenarios and some of them leaning more towards a CTF style of challenge.


 
### [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/)

The wargames offered by the OverTheWire community can help you to learn and practice security concepts in the form of fun-filled games.
 


### [Smash the Stack](http://smashthestack.org/)
 
 The Smash the Stack Wargaming Network hosts several Wargames. A Wargame in our context can be described as an ethical hacking environment that supports the simulation of real world software vulnerability theories or concepts and allows for the legal execution of exploitation techniques. Software can be an Operating System, network protocol, or any userland application.
 


### [OWASP WebGoat Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project)

### [HackerOne Free Sandboxes Replicating Real-World Bugs](https://hackedu.io/hacktivity/)

HackEDU has replicated vulnerabilities found through HackerOne’s bug bounty program that have been made public through HackerOne’s Hacktivity feed. HackEDU provides the vulnerabilities and tools to give you a safe and legal environment to learn about the vulnerabilities, how to find them, and explore the implications of exploitation in your own sandbox.
