### A Pentester’s Guide – Part 1 (OSINT – Passive Recon and Discovery of Assets)

To kick off this series on offensive security techniques, I am going to begin with what I consider to be the most important aspects of pentesting. Passive Recon and OSINT.

### A Pentester’s Guide Part 2 (OSINT – LinkedIn is Not Just for Jobs)

If you read the title, which I am sure you have, you’ll know that we’re going to utilize LinkedIn for this. LinkedIn is a very useful tool for enumerating users, and their emails.
