### Practical guide to NTLM Relaying in 2017 (A.K.A getting a foothold in under 5 minutes)

This blog post is mainly aimed to be a very 'cut & dry' practical guide to help clear up any confusion regarding NTLM relaying. Talking to pentesters I've noticed that there seems to be a lot of general confusion regarding what you can do with those pesky hashes you get with Responder. I also noticed there doesn't seem to be an up to date guide on how to do this on the interwebs, and the articles that I did see about the subject either reference tools that are outdated, broken and/or not maintained anymore.

I won't go into detail on all the specifics since there are a TON of papers out there detailing how the attack actually works, this one from SANS is a ok when it comes to the theory behind the attack.

### CVE-2017-11176: A step-by-step Linux Kernel exploitation

This series covers a step-by-step walkthrough to develop a Linux kernel exploit from a CVE description. It starts with the patch analysis to understand the bug and trigger it from kernel land (part 1), then it gradually builds a working proof-of-concept code (part 2). The PoC is then turned into an arbitrary call primitive (part 3) which is finally used to execute arbitrary code in ring-0 (part 4).

### Remote exploit in CrashPlan backup server

One of our customers commissioned a test of their infrastructure. One of their systems was running the Crashplan backup server from Code42, and we found a remote code execution possibility. As luck would have it (for our customer that is) a setting in their firewalls made it impossible to exploit it in their environment, but naturally we reported it to Code42. 
Their response was... well, not what we hoped...

### Hardware Backdoors in x86 CPUs

This talk will demonstrate what everyone has long feared but never proven: there are hardware backdoors in some x86 processors, and they're buried deeper than we ever imagined possible. While this research specifically examines a third-party processor, we use this as a stepping stone to explore the feasibility of more widespread hardware backdoors.

### Redis Remote Command Execution

Redis has eloquently explained how it can be used for remote command execution if not securely configured to mitigate arbitrary access.

### Exploiting JNDI Injections in Java

Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) is a Java API that allows clients to discover and look up data and objects via a name. These objects can be stored in different naming or directory services, such as Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), or Domain Name Service (DNS).

### How I hacked modern Vending Machines

Indisputably, Vending Machines are objects of cult. Delicious morsels of Hackers, always. In the beginning they worked offline with coins only, then, NFC- keys/cards models started spreading. If I say “COGES” I’m sure that better times will come to someone’s mind. But… In a bunch of years things changed radically. You distract and a moment after, find the world superseded by things connected to the internet…
